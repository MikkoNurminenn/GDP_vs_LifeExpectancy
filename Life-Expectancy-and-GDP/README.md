# Life Expectancy & GDP - Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project exploring the relationship between life expectancy and GDP. The project aims to determine if higher GDP is associated with longer life expectancy and examines how these variables have evolved over time.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:
- **Clean and preprocess** a dataset containing GDP and life expectancy data for various countries.
- Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** with visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and line charts.
- Calculate the **Pearson correlation coefficient** between GDP and life expectancy to quantify their relationship.
- Summarize key insights and suggest **future research directions**.

## Data

The analysis is based on a dataset (`all_data.csv`) with the following key columns:
- **Country**: The name of the country.
- **Year**: The year of the recorded data.
- **Life expectancy at birth (years)**: The average life expectancy at birth (in years).
- **GDP**: The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the country.

## Tools and Libraries

The project utilizes the following tools and libraries:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Project Structure

- `life_expectancy_gdp.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the complete analysis.
- `all_data.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
